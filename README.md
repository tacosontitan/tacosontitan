# Oh, umm, hello there. ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jamie, but you can call me Taco! I'm just another average millennial, with a ðŸ”¥ passion for all things code.

## Who am I?
Professionally, I'm a software developer with over a decade of experience in the industry. Personally, I'm, uh, awkward? I was born in 1991 and I have many hobbies, including creating software, games, and mobile apps, playing video games, and guitar, day trading, and distance running. With that, my goal in life is, and always has been, to learn and experience as much as possible, within reason.

## What do I do?
As I stated above, professionally, I'm a software developer. More specifically however I'm a framework and Windows service developer specializing in the `C#` language. As a result, I work with the following languages and technologies on a daily to weekly basis.

### What's Missing?
Well, I have sections representing the languages I work with, the tools and technologies I use the most often, along with my social media presence, and the games I play the most. However, I'm reworking the logos to get a consistent look and feel to those sections. Feel free to check the [legacy-staging branch](https://github.com/tacosontitan/tacosontitan/tree/legacy-staging) to see what's missing in more detail until I get the logos updated.
